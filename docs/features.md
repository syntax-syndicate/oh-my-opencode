## Agents: Your AI Team

Oh-My-OpenCode provides 10 specialized AI agents. Each has distinct expertise, optimized models, and tool permissions.

### Core Agents

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Sisyphus** | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` | **The default orchestrator.** Plans, delegates, and executes complex tasks using specialized subagents with aggressive parallel execution. Todo-driven workflow with extended thinking (32k budget). |
| **oracle** | `openai/gpt-5.2` | Architecture decisions, code review, debugging. Read-only consultation - stellar logical reasoning and deep analysis. Inspired by AmpCode. |
| **librarian** | `opencode/glm-4.7-free` | Multi-repo analysis, documentation lookup, OSS implementation examples. Deep codebase understanding with evidence-based answers. Inspired by AmpCode. |
| **explore** | `opencode/grok-code` | Fast codebase exploration and contextual grep. Uses Gemini 3 Flash when Antigravity auth is configured, Haiku when Claude max20 is available, otherwise Grok. Inspired by Claude Code. |
| **frontend-ui-ux-engineer** | `google/gemini-3-pro-preview` | A designer turned developer. Builds gorgeous UIs with pixel-perfect details, smooth animations, and intuitive interactions. Gemini excels at creative, beautiful UI code. |
| **document-writer** | `google/gemini-3-flash` | Technical writing expert - README, API docs, guides. Gemini is a wordsmith - writes prose that flows. |
| **multimodal-looker** | `google/gemini-3-flash` | Visual content specialist. Analyzes PDFs, images, diagrams to extract information. Saves tokens by having another agent process media. |

### Planning Agents

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Prometheus** | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` | Strategic planner with interview mode. Creates detailed work plans through iterative questioning. |
| **Metis** | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | Plan consultant - pre-planning analysis. Identifies hidden intentions, ambiguities, and AI failure points. |
| **Momus** | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | Plan reviewer - validates plans against clarity, verifiability, and completeness standards. |

### Invoking Agents

The main agent invokes these automatically, but you can call them explicitly:

```
Ask @oracle to review this design and propose an architecture
Ask @librarian how this is implemented - why does the behavior keep changing?
Ask @explore for the policy on this feature
```

### Tool Restrictions

| Agent | Restrictions |
|-------|-------------|
| oracle | Read-only: cannot write, edit, or delegate |
| librarian | Cannot write, edit, or delegate |
| explore | Cannot write, edit, or delegate |
| multimodal-looker | Allowlist only: read, glob, grep |

### Background Agents

Run agents in the background and continue working:

- Have GPT debug while Claude tries different approaches
- Gemini writes frontend while Claude handles backend
- Fire massive parallel searches, continue implementation, use results when ready

```
# Launch in background
delegate_task(agent="explore", background=true, prompt="Find auth implementations")

# Continue working...
# System notifies on completion

# Retrieve results when needed
background_output(task_id="bg_abc123")
```

Customize agent models, prompts, and permissions in `oh-my-opencode.json`. See [Configuration](configurations.md#agents).

## Skills: Specialized Knowledge

Skills provide specialized workflows with embedded MCP servers and detailed instructions.

### Built-in Skills

| Skill | Trigger | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **playwright** | Browser tasks, testing, screenshots | Browser automation via Playwright MCP. MUST USE for any browser-related tasks - verification, browsing, web scraping, testing, screenshots. |
| **frontend-ui-ux** | UI/UX tasks, styling | Designer-turned-developer persona. Crafts stunning UI/UX even without design mockups. Emphasizes bold aesthetic direction, distinctive typography, cohesive color palettes. |
| **git-master** | commit, rebase, squash, blame | MUST USE for ANY git operations. Atomic commits with automatic splitting, rebase/squash workflows, history search (blame, bisect, log -S). |

### Skill: playwright

**Trigger**: Any browser-related request

Provides browser automation via Playwright MCP server:

```yaml
mcp:
  playwright:
    command: npx
    args: ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
```

**Capabilities**:
- Navigate and interact with web pages
- Take screenshots and PDFs
- Fill forms and click elements
- Wait for network requests
- Scrape content

**Usage**:
```
/playwright Navigate to example.com and take a screenshot
```

### Skill: frontend-ui-ux

**Trigger**: UI design tasks, visual changes

A designer-turned-developer who crafts stunning interfaces:

- **Design Process**: Purpose, Tone, Constraints, Differentiation
- **Aesthetic Direction**: Choose extreme - brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, luxury, playful
- **Typography**: Distinctive fonts, avoid generic (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- **Color**: Cohesive palettes with sharp accents, avoid purple-on-white AI slop
- **Motion**: High-impact staggered reveals, scroll-triggering, surprising hover states
- **Anti-Patterns**: Generic fonts, predictable layouts, cookie-cutter design

### Skill: git-master

**Trigger**: commit, rebase, squash, "who wrote", "when was X added"

Three specializations in one:

1. **Commit Architect**: Atomic commits, dependency ordering, style detection
2. **Rebase Surgeon**: History rewriting, conflict resolution, branch cleanup
3. **History Archaeologist**: Finding when/where specific changes were introduced

**Core Principle - Multiple Commits by Default**:
```
3+ files -> MUST be 2+ commits
5+ files -> MUST be 3+ commits
10+ files -> MUST be 5+ commits
```

**Automatic Style Detection**:
- Analyzes last 30 commits for language (Korean/English) and style (semantic/plain/short)
- Matches your repo's commit conventions automatically

**Usage**:
```
/git-master commit these changes
/git-master rebase onto main
/git-master who wrote this authentication code?
```

### Custom Skills

Load custom skills from:

## Commands: Slash Workflows

Commands are slash-triggered workflows that execute predefined templates.

### Built-in Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/init-deep` | Initialize hierarchical AGENTS.md knowledge base |
| `/ralph-loop` | Start self-referential development loop until completion |
| `/ulw-loop` | Start ultrawork loop - continues with ultrawork mode |
| `/cancel-ralph` | Cancel active Ralph Loop |
| `/refactor` | Intelligent refactoring with LSP, AST-grep, architecture analysis, and TDD verification |
| `/start-work` | Start Sisyphus work session from Prometheus plan |

### Command: /init-deep

**Purpose**: Generate hierarchical AGENTS.md files throughout your project

**Usage**:
```
/init-deep [--create-new] [--max-depth=N]
```

Creates directory-specific context files that agents automatically read:
```
project/
├── AGENTS.md              # Project-wide context
├── src/
│   ├── AGENTS.md          # src-specific context
│   └── components/
│       └── AGENTS.md      # Component-specific context
```

### Command: /ralph-loop

**Purpose**: Self-referential development loop that runs until task completion

**Named after**: Anthropic's Ralph Wiggum plugin

**Usage**:
```
/ralph-loop "Build a REST API with authentication"
/ralph-loop "Refactor the payment module" --max-iterations=50
```

**Behavior**:
- Agent works continuously toward the goal
- Detects `<promise>DONE</promise>` to know when complete
- Auto-continues if agent stops without completion
- Ends when: completion detected, max iterations reached (default 100), or `/cancel-ralph`

**Configure**: `{ "ralph_loop": { "enabled": true, "default_max_iterations": 100 } }`

### Command: /ulw-loop

**Purpose**: Same as ralph-loop but with ultrawork mode active

Everything runs at maximum intensity - parallel agents, background tasks, aggressive exploration.

### Command: /refactor

**Purpose**: Intelligent refactoring with full toolchain

**Usage**:
```
/refactor <target> [--scope=<file|module|project>] [--strategy=<safe|aggressive>]
```

**Features**:
- LSP-powered rename and navigation
- AST-grep for pattern matching
- Architecture analysis before changes
- TDD verification after changes
- Codemap generation

### Command: /start-work

**Purpose**: Start execution from a Prometheus-generated plan

**Usage**:
```
/start-work [plan-name]
```

Uses atlas agent to execute planned tasks systematically.

### Custom Commands

Load custom commands from:
- `.opencode/command/*.md` (project)
- `~/.config/opencode/command/*.md` (user)
- `.claude/commands/*.md` (Claude Code compat)
- `~/.claude/commands/*.md` (Claude Code user)
