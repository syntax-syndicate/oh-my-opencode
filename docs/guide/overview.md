# Oh My OpenCode Overview

Learn about Oh My OpenCode, a plugin that transforms OpenCode into the best agent harness.

## TL;DR

> **Sisyphus agent strongly recommends Opus 4.5 model. Using other models may result in significantly degraded experience.**

**Feeling lazy?** Just include `ultrawork` (or `ulw`) in your prompt. That's it. The agent figures out the rest.

**Need precision?** Press **Tab** to enter Prometheus (Planner) mode, create a work plan through an interview process, then run `/start-work` to execute it with full orchestration.

## What Oh My OpenCode Does for You

- **Build features from descriptions**: Just tell the agent what you want. It makes a plan, writes the code, and ensures it works. Automatically. You don't have to care about the details.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error. The agent analyzes your codebase, identifies the problem, and implements a fix.
- **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your codebase. The agent maintains awareness of your entire project structure.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, write release notes - all in a single command.

## Two Ways to Work

### Option 1: Ultrawork Mode (For Quick Work)

If you're feeling lazy, just include **`ultrawork`** (or **`ulw`**) in your prompt:

```
ulw add authentication to my Next.js app
```

The agent will automatically:
1. Explore your codebase to understand existing patterns
2. Research best practices via specialized agents
3. Implement the feature following your conventions
4. Verify with diagnostics and tests
5. Keep working until complete

This is the "just do it" mode. Full automatic mode.
The agent is already smart enough, so it explores the codebase and make plans itself.
**You don't have to think that deep. Agent will think that deep.**

### Option 2: Prometheus Mode (For Precise Work)

For complex or critical tasks, press **Tab** to switch to Prometheus (Planner) mode.

**How it works:**

1. **Prometheus interviews you** - Acts as your personal consultant, asking clarifying questions while researching your codebase to understand exactly what you need.

2. **Plan generation** - Based on the interview, Prometheus generates a detailed work plan with tasks, acceptance criteria, and guardrails. Optionally reviewed by Momus (plan reviewer) for high-accuracy validation.

3. **Run `/start-work`** - The Orchestrator-Sisyphus takes over:
   - Distributes tasks to specialized sub-agents
   - Verifies each task completion independently
   - Accumulates learnings across tasks
   - Tracks progress across sessions (resume anytime)

**When to use Prometheus:**
- Multi-day or multi-session projects
- Critical production changes
- Complex refactoring spanning many files
- When you want a documented decision trail

## Critical Usage Guidelines

### Always Use Prometheus + Orchestrator Together

**Do NOT use `atlas` without `/start-work`.**

The orchestrator is designed to execute work plans created by Prometheus. Using it directly without a plan leads to unpredictable behavior.

**Correct workflow:**
```
1. Press Tab → Enter Prometheus mode
2. Describe work → Prometheus interviews you
3. Confirm plan → Review .sisyphus/plans/*.md
4. Run /start-work → Orchestrator executes
```

**Prometheus and Orchestrator-Sisyphus are a pair. Always use them together.**
